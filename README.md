# College-Enrollment-Trends
*Status: In Progress*

### Motivation
I've gained significant insights into institutional research (IR) during my job search. Initially, I did not specifically aim to work in IR, but given my background in education, I chose to focus my search on community colleges. It wasn't until I received an interview invitation that I delved into understanding IR's objectives and its crucial role on college campuses.

What particularly resonated with me was the aspect of IR dedicated to achieving various metrics of student equity. As a first-generation college graduate, education was a transformative experience for me and my family. The liberal arts education I received at St. Olaf College made me the critical thinker I am today, liberating me from a dysfunctional home environment. There's nothing more empowering than knowledge.

Although I am eager to contribute to IR, I realized that I lacked hands-on experience. To address this, I decided to start working with IPEDS data, aiming to build practical skills and deepen my understanding of the field.


### Objectives
With this project, I aim to create a user-friendly, dynamic dashboard to showcase my data wrangling and dashboard design skills. Additionally, I seek to significantly enhance my programming abilities. To achieve this, I am utilizing the resources available to me to learn the best practices for programming in R. Besides books and online articles, ChatGPT has been an invaluable resource in this endeavor.

By the end of this project, I hope to have a much better understanding of best practices for collaboration, working in virtual environments, and using version control.

### Status Details
I have successfully combined numerous large datasets from IPEDS on student enrollment across community colleges in California. However, the data is currently in long-form and needs to be reshaped into wide-form before I can proceed with further analysis and visualization. To accomplish this, I need to group related features before pivoting the data.

Additionally, I need to return to IPEDS to download more data. My initial collection did not include community colleges that are part of larger districts, resulting in missing many colleges.

As I progress, I welcome any feedback and suggestions.
